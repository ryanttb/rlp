## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- Firebase project (for database and file storage)

### Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Firebase Configuration**
   - Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   - Enable Firestore Database and Storage
   - Copy your Firebase config from Project Settings
   - Create `.env.local` file with your Firebase credentials:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your Firebase config
   ```

3. **Run development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. **Build for production**
```bash
npm run build
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.
